	2025-2-18 mmMain:redesignDisorganizedBuggyTiles2025-2-18+ which led to the creation
	of Var.e and TODO Var.setE(number) or something like that TODO.
	
	Ive probably broken the loading of tiles again but ive got to mmMain:"fix why the tiles are appearing/disappearing approx like they should but at a few hundred pixels past where the gobs appear/disappear at the sparse distance (see sparseUpdate)"

	This whole tile thing is getting too complex. Its time for a small redesign, to get things straight in the design before writing more code. Its too many places things are being stored:
	Var.ob is a QuadTile, which has a square (uint53) and a Quad.
	game.wal is a BigTile containing Tile's.
	tile.dense is a 128x128 byte array.
	tile.sparse is a Quad.
	game.board is modified by a Quad in Tile.prototype.paintGame and it remembers that in tile.lastPaintedQuadOnGame (similar to gob.voxInGame int array but its a Quad instead).

	Theres also autoEval in Var.

	Theres Var.p NOT being used for create/delete at height 2 (V.testnet.objectName.p). State was supposed to be in the Var tree but some parts are not, and its causing an avalanche of cache errors that confusing me and getting way too much stuff tangled.
	Maybe I need a bit field in Var to say if its in the game or not, or a scalar field to say gradually how much, 0 to 1 in the simplest case.
	I recently changed Gob to not change its Var (gob.bo is a Var whose Var.ob is that Gob) when you edit the textarea. The var changes, but its a new Gob. Similarly, I dont want state stored in Tile thats not in Var, which might mean I have to redesign how you paint on BigTile to queue updates in some other structure and do them all at once (before next video frame).

	These redesigns wont be covered here[[[
	wikib upgrades.
	gob.m.isSelected etc put in the Var tree.
	redesign gob.brain funcs to not modify their param Vars and instead be a pure-function (except maybe the mouse gob that reads Controls.mouseY etc) but I dont know how to do that efficiently.
	]]]

	This might turn into a bigger redesign than I thought, but think thru it carefully. In general I think I want to make game.wal (which is a BigTile) be a backing wrapper of the V/Var tree instead of storing out of sync caches of it, and I likely want another upgrade to the Var class which is Var.pExistsInGame but find something smaller to write it as maybe p.e. Yes, lets call it p.e for amount of eval, thats supposed to usually be the same as .p but .e goes thru more security checks, while .p can be changed by merging V tree across internet, its only evaled (TODO) into game.board etc  if !!p.e where p.e is normally 0 or 1. Also, we dont share Var.e across internet cuz its about local views of the Var tree, such as viewing it in a specific game.board game.gobs game.wal etc.
	...
	And im gonna need events to update things whenever .e changes, so .setE func instead of setting .e directly?

	//This is an experimental field of Var added 2024-11-13 to try to solve that gobs overlap too much, take too long to accel away from eachother,
	//so this should slightly make them instantly jump away from eachother too.
	//I just doubled constraint solving efficiency of Blob Monster Game in 2 lines of code, in Var class:
