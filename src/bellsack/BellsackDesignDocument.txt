Conversation with GPT about the Bellsack game I'm making, trying to figure out exactly what to build after the many prototypes of different stuff...



Shared Intro

Bellsack is an experimental, community-driven universe where the world itself—and even its physics—exist inside a single, gigantic mathematical object. Everything you see or do is just motion in an infinite-dimensional space of numbers. Players sculpt terrain, write micro-programs that become living creatures or fractals, and watch the whole sandbox settle toward lower “loss,” like a marble rolling across a landscape of hills and valleys. Because every rule, shader, and data point is encoded in a public JSON tree, Bellsack is fully open, remixable, and deterministic: any computer can reconstruct the same universe by reading the same numbers.

Page 1 – Welcome, New Bellsack Gamers

You’ve just spawned inside Bellsack. Unlike ordinary games, there’s no fixed map or quest line. Instead, every cave wall, monster, and ball you see is generated by player-written “species”—tiny snippets of code that shape the world’s invisible scalar field. Think of that field as cosmic clay; wherever it crosses zero, the clay hardens into visible terrain.
Your avatar is a ball. Its position, color, health, even the rules that govern it are simply numbers flowing downhill in that field. When you push forward, you’re nudging those numbers; gravity, springs, and collisions all come from the same underlying math.
Want to create? Open the in-game editor. Select a glowing sphere (that’s its bounding volume), tweak its code, and hit save. Your edit spawns a new species identified by a unique hash. If other players walk near it, their GPUs will compile your shader on the fly; if they wander off, it unloads to keep things smooth.
Bellsack is cooperative chaos: thousands of players can layer species in the same area, carving fractal caves, sculpting procedural castles, or wiring logic puzzles made of bouncing balls. Because everything is deterministic and shared, griefing is reversible and creativity is limitless. Dive in, experiment, and remember—here, editing the world is just another way of playing.

Page 2 – For AI & Game Programmers

Bellsack treats content and physics as a single differentiable program. The core state is a sparse infinite-dimensional vector V, where each dimension has a position p and velocity v. Density-field species are GLSL vertex shaders that read per-instance uniforms and write a float; the global field is max(sum(species_i)). Balls are special species whose density looks like bell curves; their collisions are resolved by signed-distance Newton steps (48 dens() calls per ball).
Editing a species produces a new GLSL pair (graphics + physics) whose SHA-256 of the source string becomes its key. Because shaders are sandboxed WebGL2 ES 300 and loaded through LamGL—a stateless wrapper around off-screen textures—runtime cost is predictable. Only 600 shaders live in GPU memory per client, with at most one compile or unload per frame.
High-level gameplay rules—chasing, flocking, resource drains—are expressed either as spring-like penalties in the loss function or as differential equations run on the CPU. A built-in mini-language (single-line JS with io()) lets creators define float-only functions that the toolchain transpiles to GLSL, counting FLOPs and registers ahead of time. Function calls use hashed names (io.funcidABC123) so the graph is static and cacheable.
Networking is peer-to-peer merge: each client simulates the same deterministic ODE with possibly

Rule 1:
The game’s scalar loss function is a universal, smooth, infinite-dimensional field representing all possible configurations of game content and all possible variants of the gameplay rules and physics, which players can create and modify through the level editor. It starts as a neutral (zero) field and is modified by players through movement in this space. Each position corresponds to a particular arrangement of gameplay behavior and content. This space is expressive enough to represent structures such as Mandelbulb fractals, sums of sine waves, Rule 110 automata, neural SAT solvers, swinging chains and ropes, and other arbitrary logic or geometry, all embedded as differentiable contributions to the global scalar. Although this function can be written in many ways, it is designed to run efficiently in WebGL2 GLSL ES 300 vertex shaders on good gaming computers.

Editing content in the level editor and playing the game are both simply forms of movement through this infinite-dimensional space. The boundary between editing and playing is fully permeable—players can mix live edits and gameplay seamlessly, without switching modes or interrupting the simulation.

This space functions like a multiverse, where each point is a coherent game universe. Synchronization across many players and computers happens by combining their local game states—such as taking the midpoint between two 1200-dimensional positions—to produce a shared, merged state. This midpoint operation is valid and meaningful because all such positions live in the same continuous space. Other forms of merging and conflict resolution are also possible, enabling smooth peer-to-peer multiplayer gameplay with overlapping but slightly differing simulations.

Rule 2:
The game world is a single continuous 3D space, populated by two types of objects:

    Balls, which are physics-driven agents with additional player-defined state variables.

    Density field objects, each defined within a sphere and contributing to a scalar density function that is used to form isosurfaces (game geometry).

Objects can only influence each other if their bounding spheres overlap, i.e., have positive intersecting volume.

Rule 3.0:

Sphere‑bounded objects come in two major types:

Density Field Objects – contribute to the scalar field used to define isosurfaces.

Ball Objects – dynamic entities with additional per‑ball variables (e.g., health, manaRefillRate). CPU‑side player logic can act on nearby balls (for instance, making red balls chase blue balls).

Rule 3.5:
Up to 30 species of density field objects can be active in any local 3D area at once. Each species corresponds to a distinct chunk of GLSL code defining its contribution to the scalar density field.

Each species is rendered and simulated via two GLSL shaders: one for graphics and one for physics.

Rule 4:
The scalar density field at any point in space is computed as the max of sums, where each sum aggregates the float outputs of all instances of a given species, and the max is taken across all active species. That is:

density(xyz) = max(
	sum over instances of species 1 at xyz,
	sum over instances of species 2 at xyz,
	...,
	sum over instances of species N at xyz
)

Each species contributes its own GLSL-defined float function, evaluated independently per instance using that instance's parameter data.

All of these float32 values across all instances are dimensions in the game’s scalar loss function—the universal, smooth, infinite-dimensional field representing all possible configurations of game content. Changing these values is equivalent to moving through content space, which can happen via player editing or physical simulation.

The isosurface is the level set where this combined density equals zero:
isosurface(xyz) ⇔ density(xyz) == 0.

All per‑instance float32 values are dimensions in the universal loss field.

Rule 5:
Balls are game entities defined by variables such as position (x, y, z), health, manaRefillRate, and other player-defined fields. Each of these variables is a dimension of the scalar loss field, just like the fields of density objects. However, balls contribute to the scalar field in a different way—typically as smooth 3D bellcurves centered at their position, causing them to repel each other or interact with terrain. Physics is computed as a double loop: one over all balls interacting with nearby terrain, and another over all nearby ball pairs. These computations occur in many small groups of nearby objects.

Rule 6:
You may attach custom differential equations to balls—such as Chua’s circuit or spring damping—but these computations occur in the CPU and are separate from the main physics cycle.

Rule 7:
Each species may also include a fixed number of constant int values per instance. These values are uploaded to GPU uniform memory and may act as the program logic for an interpreter written in GLSL (e.g., a Brainfuck-style VM or Turing-complete system).
This allows a single species to emulate many behaviors, at the cost of speed due to dynamic branching and loop overhead in GLSL.
Developers may specify the number of float and int inputs their species uses, and the shader will expect them per instance.

Rule 8:
Shader management is strictly bounded for smooth performance. A single client may hold at most 600 compiled GLSL shader programs (graphics + physics combined). During any video frame, the engine may load at most one new shader or unload one existing shader. If loading a new species would exceed the 600-shader cap, the farthest or least-recently-used species is unloaded first.

Rule 9:
The game world is divided into many sparse, possibly irregular 3D volumes, each responsible for computing rendering and physics within its region. These volumes may be shaped as cubes, spheres, or specialized forms such as raytracing pyramids—frusta that originate at the camera and intersect a small screen-aligned rectangle.

Each volume includes every sphere-bounded object that intersects it, and performs the full max-of-sums density calculation locally. The scalar field is smooth and continuous, so the result is exact (up to float precision) within the volume.

When the world is partitioned into non-overlapping cube volumes or raytracing pyramids tiled across the screen, no overlap occurs. Overlap is neither required nor encouraged, and if it does occur (for custom-shaped volumes), care must be taken to avoid double-counting physics forces in overlapping regions.

Once a volume’s contents are simulated forward, the entire game state is expressed solely by the positions and velocities of all dimensions, across all objects. The state is stateless beyond that—no hidden or external systems are required to reconstruct the full scalar field or simulation state at any time.

Rule 10:
To resolve ball‒isosurface collisions and update high‑dimensional motion in a single frame:

Signed‑distance approximation for a ball centre p0 (radius = 1):
Precompute six unit directions (±x̂, ±ŷ, ±ẑ).  For each direction:

Set p = p0 + dir (a point on the ball surface).

Do two refinement steps:

Sample the field at p → d0 = dens(p).

Estimate the gradient g with four density samples placed as the corners of an equilateral tetrahedron of edge h = 2⁻¹² around p.  Combine them as g = (dA + dB − dC − dD) / (2 h) per coordinate.

Let n = -g / length(g) (unit inward normal).

Move p += n * d0 / length(g).

Keep the smallest distance |p − p0|; that value is the ball’s signed distance to the isosurface (positive outside, negative inside).

Physics integration for every dimension i (ball or density parameter):

position[i]  += dt * velocity[i];
velocity[i]  += -dt * gradient(position)[i];   // downhill in loss
velocity[i]  *= exp(-dt * velocityDecayPerSecond);

The gradient is the negative of the loss‑field gradient at the current high‑dimensional position, so motion follows a smooth “rolling downhill” behaviour with damping.  All state needed for the next frame is fully captured by the updated position and velocity vectors—no additional data is required.

Rule 11:
The scalar loss function is not merely the vertical height (gravity) term for balls; it also includes penalty terms that repel or discourage invalid configurations. A common penalty for ball–surface contact is:

loss_penalty = weight * max(0, ballRadius - signedDistanceToIsosurface)^2

where signedDistanceToIsosurface is positive outside the surface and negative when penetrating. The weight parameter (per object or per rule) decides the strength of this constraint. Similar quadratic penalties can be defined for any prohibited combination of dimensions—enabling custom gameplay rules such as keeping certain balls apart, enforcing joint limits, or clamping energy levels.

Rule 12:
The data format is json similar to this, where each node has p/position and v/velocity, assumed 0 if not given:

			uvsphere:{},
			species:{

Rule 13: Tree-Structured Infinite Vector Space & Data Diffing

    Dimension Representation
    The entire game state is an infinite-dimensional vector realized as a JSON tree.
    Each leaf (dimension) contains at minimum

{ "p": float32, "v": float32 }

and may include additional fields (e.g., "comment", "stream").

.big Field and Node Naming
If a node has a "big" field, the node’s key must be the hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the exact bytes of "big".

    .big holds substantial code or data (e.g., a species’ GLSL source).

    The hash guarantees uniqueness and allows deduplication.

Diff-Friendly Sync

    A full object with .big is sent only once.

    Frequent updates use diff messages that omit the .big field and transmit only the changing { "p", "v", ... } values.

    Peers reconstruct the full state by combining cached .big blobs with incoming diffs, minimizing bandwidth.

Example Path

V.bellsack.room1.species.
  sha256$07d59eac64a7...012a8df6.
    makeUpAnId56532.x.p

refers to the x-position (.p) of the instance makeUpAnId56532 belonging to the species whose code hash is 07d59eac….

State Sufficiency
The vector of all p and v values—plus any linked .big blobs already cached—is all that’s needed to reconstruct, save, load, or merge the game state.



Rule 14: Shader Lifecycle, Identity, and Versioning

Edits to a species’ GLSL code may result in a new version, but only if the .big array content changes. The identity of a species is defined by the SHA-256 hash of its .big array.

Species are treated as immutable code units. If the .big array remains unchanged, the existing species is reused, regardless of user interaction or attempted edits.

In the editor, each species shows its full namespace path, for example:
//V.bellsack.room5.species.sha256$ed2456914e48c1e17b7bd922177291ef8b7f553edf1b1f66b6fc1a076524b22f
This path updates continuously as the user types. The hash always reflects the current .big content.

To inspect which code is associated with a given species, users can run in the browser console:
V.bellsack.room5.species.sha256$ed2456914e48c1e17b7bd922177291ef8b7f553edf1b1f66b6fc1a076524b22f.big
This returns the exact array of source strings used to define that shader.

Shader version is part of the high-dimensional game state. Some objects may continue to use older species, while others switch to new ones. There is no enforced retirement of versions. Shader versioning is a dimension like any other, and coexisting versions are part of the game’s multiverse model.

Rule 15: Shader Processing via LamGL

Shaders are written in WebGL2 GLSL ES 300 vertex shader format and processed off-screen using WebGLTexture outputs. Inputs consist solely of float and int arrays via GL uniform memory—no input textures are used.

Shader computation is managed through LamGL, a JavaScript library defined as:

const Lamgl = (() => { ...build the function... })();

LamGL performs stateless GPU calls from within the browser. It takes a JavaScript object {} representing immutable blocks of GPU memory, along with (in future updates) a small number of uniform float and int arrays, and returns a new {} representing the output blocks of GPU memory.

LamGL does not have any privileged execution capability—it operates entirely within the browser’s standard WebGL sandbox. It is comparable to libraries like TensorFlow.js or GPU.js, facilitating structured GPU-based computation without escaping browser constraints.

Rule 16: Built-in Float-Oriented Function Language

The system includes a built-in mini language for defining numeric functions that compile safely and predictably to GPU shaders. Each function is declared as:

(io) => { ... }

Where io() reads the next input value (either int or float, in that order), and io(x) writes a float output. No heap allocation is allowed; all variables must be local let bindings of type float or int. All loops must be of constant iteration count and easily statically analyzable. This allows safe translation into GLSL ES 300 without introducing performance instability or risk of browser hangs.

Functions can call other functions by their SHA-256 hash ID using the syntax io.funcidHASHNAME(...), allowing composable and recursive logic structures. Each function declares its constant number of float inputs, float outputs, and int inputs in its metadata.

For example, the following is a valid function definition under this model:

funcOTHERHASH342344444444444444444 = (io) => {
	let cx = io(), cy = io(); // floatInputs = 2
	let zx = 0.0, zy = 0.0;
	for (let _ = 0; _ < 16; _++) {
		let xt = zx*zx - zy*zy + cx;
		let yt = 2.0*zx*zy + cy;
		zx = xt;
		zy = yt;
	}
	let [r, g, b] = io.funcidHashABCDEF(zx, zy);
	io(r);
	io(g);
	io(b);
}

This defines a Mandelbrot-style function that accepts two float inputs (complex coordinates), performs 16 iterations, then maps the result to RGB color using a secondary function funcidHashABCDEF. The output is three float values corresponding to red, green, and blue.

This language supports exact accounting of compute cost and GPU memory use, and enables massive-scale programmable content across the game universe without runtime surprises.
