Blob Monsters Game has 3 teams (red green blue), displays distance to nearest voxel of each. 9 bytes per pixel. 26 bits counts num of monsters touching this pixel. 6 bit color of voxels (24 bit color for the distance fields). 10 bits for distance up to 255. 3 bits for team masks. See game.rps.team, game.rps.tridist, game.board, and game.gob[int].m.team.

/*
let me explain the math behind this potential energy calculation.

Think of it as a heightmap in range 0..1 for x and y. z can be any nonnegative scalar at every (y,x) in that range. Thats the root node. It has 4 childs that are each of size 1/2 by 1/2, and they have 4 childs that are each of size 1/4 by 1/4 and so on until they get down to 1/4096 x 1/4096. Each of those squares has 4 numbers. Ive been using 4 times less numbers by making them share the number at corners with their adjacent nodes, but as we've added 2 low bits to ptr, we wont share anymore. Either way the math will be the same.

Each node is a ptr and its 1 int (in qint array) and 1 flo (in qflo array). It has no other data. The ranges used in qint dont overlap the ranges used in qflo, so you can think of them as separate arrays.

Each node is computed as a simulated stack toward higher z, of 3 things:
childs
self
parents

Recursion only happens into parents, not into childs. Earlier recursions that started from my childs (of childs of childs...) will have updated self, but when self is updated, self does not recurse that direction cuz theres exponentially many childs but only log number of parents.

Childs are at higher z than self. Self is at higher z than parents.

Imagine a flat ground that you stack blocks on. You are self. You are told to rise (qint[self] += val) by val. You are a particular function z(y,x)=>number. That number is multiplied by qint[self], so qint[self]*z(y,x) is how much z you contribute at (y,x). Every (y,x) has log number of nodes add z there.

When you rise, you are lifting the mass of childs at each (y,x) you and childs both touch. How much? We dont track mass like that. What we track is sum of self(y,x)*child(y,x) for all y x overlaps, and sum that into qflo[self]. child adds into all log number of its parents qflos when child changes its qint, so parents later know (when parent's qint changes later) how much child its lifting. This is done in bilinearMult. bilinearMult does self(y,x)*child(y,x) depending how you use it.

I explained summing poten due to lifting childs. Let me get to the other thing QAdd does. Once childs are lifted, theres an empty space between parents and childs, of height z(y,x)*val at each (y,x). We must also compute the poten change due to filling that hole with mass. We get that mass from height 0 where it has no poten and lift it all the way up to the curvy floor made of parents. We dont move parents. So ive been interpolating parents to get their z sum at each of my 4 corners, then calling bilinearPotentialEnergy twice, once on that as is, and once on that plus what im adding by val, aka the curvy floor vs the curvy ceiling that i made an empty space, a cave, by lifting childs.

//first, compute potential energy of self and parents, but NOT childs (use qflo for that),
		//and after that, compute the change in potential energy by adding the "val" param to 1 corner of each of the 4 tarps,
		//and finally update parents qflo so if they change later, as I'm one of their childs, they know I changed.

			//This part with QInterp8k is for measuring poten change due to self increasing in size.
			//Its childs on top of self on top of parents. Self gets bigger, and that has to pay for
			//lifting mass from height 0 to self's current height.
			//
			//parent is bigger than child, but view parent interpolated at childs corners.
			//TODO optimize?: If selfOrParent==ptr then these numbers are directly in the qint array

				//this is similar to bilinearPotentialEnergy but is a different func
				//that multiplies the 2 z heights at each (y,x)

OLD:

proceed with 128x128 pieces of Quad. name each by hash id. Use Square (uint53) as key of it, and pair of Quad and dense Uint8Array as val.
Make a class so can edit it and know which needs updating, replace Quad and empty the Uint8Array, or mod that array and clear the Quad.
Just keep a var thats 1 0 or -1 for if one was updated before or after or at same time as the other.


2024-12-16 ive decided to proceed with Quad, not more complex kind with isComplexFork. make terrain asap
but todo bring in some of the features of the more advanced kind, like bits to say which of 4 childs are included,
and maybe some of the symbols mean heights 0..24. Or maybe QTRANSPARENT being only 1 byte we dont need an optimization for it?
Leave quad as it is and just start using it. Make game.wal be a Quad instance of whole 2**24 X 2**24 game area
or whichever parts we know about.

Its by design very fast to get the array pointer from a qvoxel. 3595161826117&0x7ffffff
returns 5763909. Just takes the low 27 bits of the positive integer. And thats what index
you use it in the Int32Array qint and Float64Array qflo.
A qvoxel is an integer between 1 and ((2**53)-1)=9007199254740991, that refers to a 1x1, 2x2,
4x4, or up to 8192x8192, area of the screen to paint 1 of 64 colors and add a height between
plus/minus 500k (for mountains, valleys, saddlepoints, and other shapes of game objects).
You will only be able to use some of those "height between plus/minus 500k" when using
bigger (in screen size) qvoxels, cuz I can only compute the total potential energy of the
game world if all squares I do physics on have at their 4 corners a multiple
of 6 (height/brightness/z). -- https://x.com/benrayfield/status/1886476184625766424 2025-2-3.
The number of joules of potential energy of the whole simulation is always an integer.
I'm making a game-tree. Many paths can lead the same place. Many paths lead to ever expanding
worlds of all possible combos. Functions are dimensions you can fade them in and out.
The amount of mass is an integer, and the amount of potential energy is an integer,
or if its not then theres still some bugs around, things to scale, etc.
When a voxel is added on top of other voxels of varying sizes and positions, that they
partially overlap, mass must sometimes be created by paying the energy cost to lift from
potential energy 0 to current potential energy.

Play my experimental Blob Monsters Game 023 at https://humanai.net/experiments/blobMonsterGame/blobMonstersGame_023.html It doesnt work very well yet, is not much fun yet, but I have shapeshifting turing complete constraint solver ability and am planning to scale up to massively multiplayer and make some basic game content. The many players, if they like the content I make, will help expand the game with new content. You can write javascript code of 1 lambda into the text box on the left, for whichever "blob monster" is selected with the mouse so is flashing.

Some parts made by the combo of me and GPT-4 GPT-o1-preview or similar versions of GPT, which by this legal statement has entirely transferred copyright of that to code to me, as I pushed it through the space of possible code, and similarly it pushed me, back and forth in javascript code changes, which I opensourced as MIT:

an opensource (MIT) 2d video game made of Blob Monsters which are a bunch of shapeshifting voxels made by any javascript code. Planned to be massively multiplayer and peer to peer but you can run it local too. Each monster has its own code, and any player can change that code while playing. Each variable is a dimension and has position and velocity, like m.p is position and m.v is velocity in game.addFunc((m,b)=>{ let voxs = []; for(let x=0; x<500; x++) voxs.push(YXC(.0001*(m.p*x*x+b.p), x, 0b000011)); return voxs; }); Play Blob Monsters Game now at https://humanai.net/experiments/blobMonstersGame.html in a desktop browser such as fastest in Chrome or OperaGX but works in many browsers slowly. Its not working very well yet and is not much fun yet but that will change soon. Players can create new game content already using the textarea on the left of the game, by selecting any monster (it keeps flashing) and editing that text, but make sure to copy/paste it cuz you might break the game and lose that text. You can paste it back in there while a monster is selected to transform that monster.

2024-11-26+ There is now an option to turn Rock Paper Scissors glowing color game on/off by "game.doRps.p = 1;" to turn it on and = 0 to turn it off, on browser console. They are shapeshifting blob monsters either way. -- https://www.facebook.com/groups/blobmonstersgame/posts/1762526854563236/

Blob Monsters Game is the result of advanced math research. Here's a 128x128 grid of 4SAT solver. It solves it so fast I paint it with 2 mouse buttons, and it forms into the turing-complete triangles of rule110. Now they've got a 8192x8192 grid, expanding to a million by a million for massively multiplayer, and each monster can paint voxels wherever it wants, not just right next to itself. When 2 monsters paint the same pixel at the same time, it repels them.

and at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/blobmonstersgame/posts/1759387181543870/
..
There are 4 teams: red, green, blue, and gray. Red green and blue each have 1 predator team and 1 prey team. Red becomes green becomes blue becomes red, around and around, when they touch.
RED touches GREEN -> both GREEN.
GREEN touches BLUE -> both BLUE.
BLUE TOUCHES RED -> both RED.
Touch is symmetric, doesnt matter who touches who. they're touching the same pixel at the same time or not. Each monster is made of 2d voxels that touch other voxels at the same pixel. Each voxel is an int32: 13 bits of y, 13 bits of x, 2 bits of red, 2 bits of green, 2 bits of blue. Its a color in an 8kX8k square. 64 possible colors.
var predatorOf = team=>{
 if(team == REDTEAM) return GREENTEAM;
 if(team == GREENTEAM) return BLUETEAM;
 if(team == BLUETEAM) return REDTEAM;
 throw new Error('team='+team+' but expected it to be 1 of 3 teams. is it multiple teams, or what?');
};
var preyOf = team=>{
 if(team == GREENTEAM) return REDTEAM;
 if(team == BLUETEAM) return GREENTEAM;
 if(team == REDTEAM) return BLUETEAM;

};
..
Any player can view or edit the javascript code of any monster by selecting it with mouse, then code is in the text box on the left. It changes live while you edit it. You can share these small javascript codes in this facebook group and others cvan paste them in to play them, even to interact multiple of them together. Later this will be automatic in the massively multiplayer game.
..
Its not just 1 kind of monster, or a million kinds of monsters. Its every possible kind. If you make a tiny graphics algorithm in the editor, that makes pics depending on vector input (Y, X, heightToWidthRatio, otherThingB, etc...)=>{...make int voxels...}, then the game automatically varies that vector looking around for possible pics it makes. At each moment in the game, each monster makes 1 pic, of the exponentially many possible pics it can make. Wherever 2 of those pics overlap, they repel. When pushed like that, a pic changes to another similar pic that the monster can also create. Its a high dimensional constraint solver. heightToWidthRatio.p is position of heightToWidthRatio, and heightToWidthRatio.v is its velocity, and similar for otherThingB.p and otherThingB.v. The game doesnt know what heightToWidthRatio and otherThingB are. You make up whatever names you want, and it turns them into dimensions and constraint solves them. And does the red green blue team logic as they capture eachother by Rock Paper Scissors per voxel. You make a pic generating algorithm, and the game brings it to life.
..
I'd like to eventually expand Blob Monsters Game to 1 million simultaneous players. in a 1 million X 1 million pixel game area. Its 8k X 8k now. The math says it can work. Player created content will keep things endlessly interesting, new patterns forever. Peer to peer so nobody controls it. Just a bunch of computers and people building and playing together. It does not surprise me that ppl dont like it yet, that hardly anyone notices it. Thats just how KFactor works. You keep improving something until it passes KFactor=1 then it goes viral. And I've got the math to make that happen. All I gotta do is double the number of players 20 times. From the moment I wrote the first line of code that was the plan. It was designed from the start to scale like that. I'm a pure-function expert. I can move functions faster than Big Tech cuz I'm not weighed down with bloat. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-factor_(marketing)
..
Blob Monsters Game has a feature that Dagball lacks (my 2 games). The monsters can touch eachother. In dagball monsters can only touch bouncing balls cuz its so inefficient, but its all voxels to all voxels now. It had better graphics, but I'm taking this all the way. I just released Dagball V2, since I probably wont be updating it for a long time.

Neural shapeshifter in dagball. I'd like to make a GPU plugin for Blob Monsters Game to include these. "Dagball_2024-5-7-9aET_recurrentSigmoidNeuralnetWith22NodesTrainedLiveInGPUShader.mp4" and is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boQ9OvRz5U .

I wrote this, not knowing if it would work out, about 6 weeks ago (2024-10), and now I'm getting ready to scale up a video game to massively multiplayer which computes the 2d form of it. 3d is just too much data, but if u wanna bring more computers it could be done the same way. I wasnt sure it was the right equation. but soon I tested it. If this game scales up to a million simultaneous players, it is still a single equation that many dimensional sparse dimensional gradient happens on. That is why it will sync at low lag and why it will work and why Im going to beat the Big Tech giants. The world appears to me as a giant cellular automata that I can now build on in the form of equations that people and computers interact with eachother thru. Once it expands it doesnt stop.
3d wavefunction: poten (game) = integral_x integral_y integral_z integral max(0,things-1). accel = -gradient(poten).
See the relevant code in Game.prototype.addVox = function(voxel), addVoxWithTeam, remVox, remVoxWithTeam, etc.

When I say online multiplayer I mean swarms. Blob Monsters Game wont be able to do exactly this cuz the math it is based on cant efficiently do friction (might have to simulate simplex-noise or something). All its surfaces are superconductors superfluids etc. No friction at all. It does have anyVar.kv as continuous decay rate (using Math.exp) of every dimension and variable, but it doesnt depend on things rubbing eachother. It just stops the world from exploding. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TxGgmR7fgU "Shutter Crush - Marble Race Countries in Algodoo".

See zoom out to whole terapixel (1048576 X 1048576) game area at once, but its only repeating the 8192x8192 (64 megapixel) area that it loads and unloads game content in. I broke the red green and blue glows (distance caches for chasing/running from eachother) and it wont select monsters with the mouse anymore, but the world expanding is proceeding.

max(0,things-1) as a loss/potentialEnergy function means at most 1 thing here, and when used with the integral_x integral_y etc, it means the sum of those, where 0 means true and positive means false, and the more positive the more unlikely it is, as usual in a loss function. So in a 2d or 3d space, the equation means that at every possible 3d position there are either 0 or 1 things but not more than 1, and if more than 1, then repel that possible world in the multiverse space.

TODOS
-- make immutable object type (PartialGameState) thats any set of the game area (which is 2**20 X 2**20) but only the wall vs open area vs unspecified if its wall or open area. And similarly, each gob having a primaryKey of gob.big (or gob.name, see gob.text() which returns one or the other) which is basically primaryKey of the js code string of js lambda (gob.brain)... may make it inefficient to sync and would be more efficient if it was just content addressable with no primaryKey, its just wherever those gobs are (not even where they paint, but where their Y.p and X.p lambda params are in 2d game coords. Im thinking about using gob.name as primaryKey of the TYPE of "blob monster" but u can have any number of instances and they all gotta have Y and X as their first 2 lambda params. So every gob is at a specific 1 of the 2**40 pixels of game coords, at all times. But there can be multiple instances of it, and which such pixel theyre at would be part of their primaryKey (the other part being their js code). I want the Bloomtree/Bitpic (from dagball) kind of 2d compression to be expanded (fork it for Blob Monsters Game) to also have a Var's contents (such as a Gob, where gob.ob is the var of that gob, and gob.ob.bo===gob) as data and the floored (round down) 2**20 X 2**20 (pixelOfTera meaning 1 of terapixel number of pixels in the sparse voxel/pixel space) coordinate of it is part of its primaryKey. Lets also limit each pixelOfTera to at most 1 Gob at a time. That gob can have a more precise y and x position (thats rounded down to the pixel index its in) as they are float64s and have position and velocity and epsilon and accelMul and gp each (those last 3 are constants defined in the code string, but position and velocity vary many times per second when an object is not paused/frozen). Basically, i think ive found a way to turn this back into a pure cellular automata again, with all data being stored in individual pixels (of 2**40 sparse pixels), and that data is a js code string and a position and velocity (float64s), at each moment. It might also have t (utc time) like Var.t is a new field of Var, not used yet 2024-11-20 but is there cuz each Var is a vector stream of position and velocity at every possible time, so a mapping of time to position and velocity that is incomplete/transparent in the future, cached well at any NOW, and may be stored or not for THEPAST. But basically its just position velocity and the last t it was updated in case the object is frozen. Or maybe should just mark is it frozen or not. I want the Bloomtree (from dagball) kind of 2d image compression to be expanded to make sparse pieces of this fit together. ITS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE SPARSE PIECES SUCH AS B C, B.poten(C) -> amount of potentialEnergy/loss to add if both of these occur at once by merging them to their average high dimensional vector or something like that. Very high poten (repel force) between 2 "make immutable object type thats any set of the game area" (as written earlier in this paragraph) would happen if they are just incompatible, like if one of them has different game rules than the other or does not allow use of the 'Math.random' function which the other of B or C has in any of its code strings or whatever reason. Its important cuz thats how it will, by boltzmann or hopfield network with those poten as the weights the value of adding each will be a different field B.biasPoten C.biasPoten (todo choose a field name for it, is biasPoten ok?), will set each of them to -1 or 1 or maybe to 0 or 1, by that energy. The B.poten(C) function may be expensive but also only need be called once and other than roundoff should be deterministic. Those boltzmann or hopfield weights may also be adjusted by simulation finding that some of the objects tend to break eachother or cause vanishing/exploding gradient or something, but that should be coded as making another such object ExcludeThatStuffIDislike and including ExcludeThatStuffIDislike.poten(B) and ExcludeThatStuffIDislike.poten(C). And u can even call ExcludeThatStuffIDislike.poten(ExcludeThatStuffIDislike) to make sure its self consistent by its own rules. We are looking for a clique, as in NP-Complete math, of sparse pieces of the game world. How would this keep track of which gob is selected? Could just have that be one of the Var fields. its in Gob.m.isSelected and Gob.m.isSelectable. That could just be copied to the other pixel. But the bigger problem is, the peer to peer net wont be exactly in sync always, will disagree on gobs being where, and if a gob can be at multiple pixelOfTeras at once (y x coords) as it can have multiple instances, then when we see 1 of those in one PartialGameState and 2 of those near that in another PartialGameState, or just 1 of those but at a different position, or combos like that, then it could be they're disagreeing on how many of them there should be, or it could be they had another such gob from farther away come and be near a gob of its same type. The problem is in peer to peer net (which as of 2024-11-20 does not exist but is planned) its hard to tell the difference between disagreeing on positions vs disagreeing on how many gobs of a certain type (js code string) there are. Id like that to be in B.poten(C) where B and C are both PartialGameState's, but i need to define how to detect that, as math. .......... [[I have math for something better than https. Its pure-functions called on eachother in all possible pairs, which you'll navigate sparsely as each will look like a "blob monster" in a video game for example and be copy/pasteable. Some kinds of these could make every existing hash algorithm and every existing digital signature algorithm, hash and sign eachother in every combo. Not that I need it for that, I'll just use ed25519 and sha256 by default, but what I do need it for is that quicksaves/quickloads of nearby parts of my game world (PartialGameState) can disagree with eachother in a peer to peer network (in theory which doesnt exist yet 2024-11-20) but based on them each being called on eachother (B.poten(C) for example, see my other post), the entire system globally syncs to include every possible thing that could happen, might has well does happen as we can gradient against it,  It has no time. All possible pasts, presents, and futures are facts of math that can each allow vs repel eachother by NP-Complete math. I am trying to turn an existing prototype of my video game (Blob Monsters Game, which is 1 html file) into a massively multiplayer game-theory experiment. If my new kind of game-theory works, then the game will scale and expand and have KFactor > 1, go viral and be self sustaining past superintelligence.

-- make BloomTree/BitPic based gobs/vars and use Var.searchYXR to find them, and make there be an easy way to know which to replace when painting with mouse 2 buttons 1 to paint walls and 1 to paint open areas aka delete walls.
-- Decide if I want mutid or not, where at most 1 of varnameABC.p can be nonzero (to say it exists) which have same mutid, so you can edit the code of a gob/blobMonster which means its primaryKey changes, so its 2 different gobs/vars, but thru mutid would automatically exclude eachother. Should it be in the Var.name, like mutidBob_sha256$sdfasdfasdfasdfasdf vs mutidBob_sha256$ssssssfdfddddddddddd or something like that? but mutidBob_sha256$sdfasdfasdfasdfasdf.mutid would be a string that would be derived from the name. Seems overly complex, but it does something useful. Figure out how to get it simple and useful, or choose not to use it. How else would it know to replace a powOf2 sized square of BloomTree compressed wall with another edited such wall? mutid is useful in dagball. It might be here too. But only within that namespace. Or maybe i should use V.theNamespace.theMutid.theJsCode?
-- use Var.searchYXR to find gobs/vars to display sparsely, and scroll the 8kX8k area by wrapping, not by copying. its already displaying that way, so simply remove some gobs/vars and add others, where gobnameABC.p==0 or ==1 determines if exists or if displays here. Maybe should be a separate gobnameABC.existsInView55 or something. or just use game.gobs which is a js [] list.

-- make game state loadable/saveable as json (V.toMap()). 2024-11-21 or earlier, toMap makes json, but not loading it yet.
-- start using V.testnet.gobnameABC.p==0 to mean delete that gobnameABC and ==1 to create or keep gobnameABC.
-- make 1 JSP file that remembers some basic serverMoney shortterm as a way to rate limit possible spammers and uploaders of huge amount of content, but start creating content in browser and uploading/downloading it there. Put searchYXR etc there too, have queries go by that.
-- Make a kind of object with an ed25519 publickey generated by a password (have code in Dagverse.js to modify) to put 1 mouse circle in the shared game area per publicKey. The rest are whatever gobs are there, but each mouse gets to move around. Will have more advanced controls later.

See that slightly jagged line between the 2 green blobs. Thats cuz its doing dijkstra shortest path finding, between each pixel and the 8 adjacent pixels. Thats where the colors come from. They estimate distance: 3 to up down left right. 4 to upleft upright downleft downright.

4/3 is a poor substitute for sqrt(2). Id have liked to use 7/5 but i only had 2 extra bits in 10 bit distance if i want about max distance of 256. I can compute ddistance squared exactly for every pixel to every voxel but its alot slower

As long as the distance-like algorithm is the same within a peer to peer net sharing a 8k X 8k canvas, it will sync exactly. Theres a correct 10 bits for every pixel (times 3 teams) for each possible world state.
Lambda Rick /acc

It does 3 dijkstras at once in the same int array. State of dijkstra is entirely in that array and 2 loops, one forward then one backward, each reading 5 of the 9 ints as 3x3 (like in conways game of life) and writes the center int. All 9 ints are in CPU L1 cache, hella fast

A world state is a set of javascript lambdas and a position and velocity for each param. The pambda returns an int array of any size, even varying the size based on params, 1 int per 2d voxel in 8k X 8k shared canvas and 64 possible colors. It changes by high dimensional gradient
Lambda Rick /acc
@benrayfield
·

To approx high dimensional gradient, it removes a lambda (of n params) from world state, computes total potential energy, then calls lambda n+1 times to get n+1 arrays of voxels, counts collisions where pixels (of 64 megapixels) are written twice. Also can add to energy directly

Each pixel can store, in just 9 bytes, up to 2^26-1 voxels which have the same (x,y) coordinate and may differ in color and team. There are 3 teams. Usually stores 0-2 voxels. It can do this cuz its entirely reversible by xor and counting of color and team mask.
Lambda Rick /acc
@benrayfield
I had to support 64 million voxels overlapping in the same pixel, without any slowdown in computing gradient, cuz some users will likely DoSAttack a shared canvas. They will fail.

 I dont know what to call it, but its doing something like raytracing. But instead of the usual rays its a triple dijkstra per pixel, emitted from every voxel in all directions. Nothing in there is just for graphics. These rays will for teams to chase and run from eachother.
 I have 2 bits unused in the triple dijkstra. 10 bits per distance. 3 distances to nearest team (of 3 teams). So I could put a wall bit in there, which would make the raytracing curve around walls, take a longer path, and display darker the longer the path goes.
If I did this, and once i hook the blob monsters into it to chase and run from the other 2 teams, then they would automatically do basic pathfinding, would automatically take the correct path thru a maze, for example.
If I had 3 bits left I would have used 11 bits per distance instead of 10. but there is no int33. its int32.
but I'd have to go back to the priority-queue of what order to update the pixels, instead of the constant order it is now, which would make it take 3 times longer cuz i couldnt do 3 dijkstras at once, and would take log(numPixels) times longer cuz of the priority queue. nevermind.

also need to check for combos of [] 0 null undefined true false {} '' etc, which + a[b] etc in combos with eachother, might be able to do eval of arbitrary string, and if so then this preprocessing step should replace them with such a literal code the redo the constraints

The power of a cross-site-scripting reactor is not supposed to be by security flaw, tho its designed to safely contain any bit strings even if theyre computer viruses (if given execute permission, so do ur own proofs 1st if u do that). The power is in the shared worlds it builds.

If such code is valid under the rules of the simulation (and which sim you want to do is up to you, its your billions of transistors), then in theory (if it ended up being coded this way, which im still in early research about) it just another way to write the same thing.

this blob species "neural shapeshifter" would be just another JS func that happens to call the GPU thru my opensource local API,
but I'd have to upgrade Blob Monsters Game to have a parallel API where you can call monster.brain(...(monster.vars))
monster.length+1 times at once.
If i copy a 80x80 pic of 1 bit per pixel, into GPU, I can copy it into EVERY GPU core at once, or at least usefully 1000 of them,
and compute collisions inside the GPU cores, so return the loss function. 1001 GPU threads to compute the gradient of float[1000]
loss function.loss function.


The fun game content should come from that Blob Monsters Game is a turing-complete constraint solver that can solve about a million vars at once. Thats what I gotta build on. When you zoom out to 64 million it updates most of the 64 megapixels slower, those near the mouse fast.
Imagine players build forts or stacks or chains and other simple machines, of combos of these shapeshifting blob monsters (which can shapeshift in far more advanced ways than shown here). 50 players in one fort. 70 players in another. Try to invade cuz colors spread exponentially -- https://x.com/benrayfield/status/1857501980366672174
What kinda "simple machines" could u build? Maybe... catapult, gearbox with stick shift and realistic torque, 2 squares that if u turn them relative to eachother they wormscrew closer/farther from eachother, a wrench to grab such a square, 3 elevators which total constant height.
The game is open-ended. In general a team wins by turning the game world to their own color (red, green, or blue), but as its turing-complete and has a code editor on every player's screen (select any object), I cant know all the possible ways to win. I will be surprised.

Blob Monsters Game 019 has decentralized sync built in among its hundreds of megabytes of memory (in browser) already. Doesnt update all the pixels at once, but does update all of them soon and those near mouse instantly and near any random voxel of any random game object #web3 -- https://x.com/benrayfield/status/1857518756324585793

TODO still use ints in gob.brain but have it check game.offsetY game.offsetX or something like that, or put it in Var instances in params somehow
maybe but dont complicate them. Define it in math this way?...
binheapY 21 bits, binheapX 21 bits, 6 bits color, mask 5 bits, fits in uint53 which fits in float64.
The 5 bits are for teams REDTEAM GREENTEAM BLUETEAM WALLTEAM and a bit for is it moveable vs constant,
which it should be constant (todo fix mouse gob to have more than 0 params, and set those params
by Var.mn and Var.mx (min and max truncation) by Controls.mouseY etc, so anything which has 0 params automatically is marked as constant in that bit,
so 53 bit voxels in the expanded form that can handle powOf2 aligned voxels in a 1 terapixel space (2**20 each of y and x, with an extra bit for binheap).
Dont do variable size voxels. Use 2 voxels if u wanna do that, to define a top left and bottom right corner, or something like that.
How about y22 x22 color6 teamMask3, where neutralTeam is teamMask of 0?
Or I could just use 2 bits for team, for 4 teams red green blue wall.
Probably best to leave a few extra bits for future expansion.
Go with y20 x20 color6 teamMask4 reservedForFutureExpansion3. fits in uint53 that fits in float64.
Choose a place to put offsetY and offsetX which are each uint20 and never get too close to the millionXmillion square for the 8kX8k to fall off or wrap.
1mX1m space, 64 colors, and 4 team bits, comes to 50 bits.
I could use just 2 team bits if its 1 of 4 specific teams (red green blue wall), but what if i want more teams for powerups or something later?
I should just put Var.m.offsetY Var.m.offsetX as a place to put extra variables like this?
I like using 5 hex digits for y and x as coords. that seems like something players would prefer over a partial hex digit which u get with
2million or 4milllion or 8million but next hex digit as 16million. 1million seems a good size to snap that to.
or should offsetY and offsetX just be global vars? var offsetY = 0x576bb;
Go with 20 bits of y, 20 bits of x.
Do I want to shrink the 8kX8k to 4kX4k so it fits in 3 hex digits? i could fit 2 bits of team in there, but gob.brain shouldnt have to know its team.
8kX8k works already (2024-11-16). The 4kx4k area in its center, or maybe 6kX6k area in its center, would be computed here but border of 1k to 2k wide
would just read whats nearby in the huge game world. 1mX1m world.
See game.oy and game.ox and game.ns.

Earth's diameter is 42 light-milliseconds. "chevron 8 is locked" (normally 7). metaphorically.

If I get this API working, every namespace has pixel indexs ranging 0x0000000000 to 0xffffffffff aka 1 teravoxel.
Earth's diameter is 42 light-milliseconds. "chevron 8 is locked" (normally 7). metaphorically. I'm about to run shared turing-complete million X million size canvases (sparse voxels), across earth where diff areas of canvas are separated by lightspeed lag. https://youtu.be/z72GiUz2VI8?si=9TmsSznuKxFLIRKG&t=84
We might in some ways of using the system be able to ballpark estimate lightspeed by max internet speed, like recursive dijkstra. not that we need to. but half or so of lag in games is generally cuz of lightspeed.
I can do alot of steps and a few network hops before light reaches between the multiple computers I'm controlling.
These coordinates in million X million pixels should be used in saved and loaded game states. I havent made those files yet
but this seemed an important thing to do before it.
..
I want 1 million simultaneous players in my Blob Monsters Game. So I expanded address space to exactly 1048576x1048576 pixels (1 terapixel),
sparsely as voxels, 6 bit color, 10 bit glowing distance cache for each of 3 Rock Paper Scissors teams, 1 bit per team is it touching pixel
-- https://x.com/benrayfield/status/1857920330532028545
Within a namespace, everyone can see all 2^40=1099511627776 (1.1 trillion) pixels and scroll and zoom in/out but some things will
look blurry or missing as they're loading. 60 FPS if u play at 512x512 resolution not zoomed out too far, or u can fiddle with it. Swarm the games.
Game state is turing-complete compressed in the form of each game object (Gob)'s primaryKey is a string of JS code of a lambda that returns an
int array of int voxels, with data of a vector of a position and velocity per lambda param. Will soon expand to 1048576x1048576 addresses.
its 1024 times wider and 1024 times taller than this (pic of 1024x1024 resolution with a 768x768 in it).
Even those its sparse, I hope to live fill at 60 FPS every one of those pixels, though in more relaxed games u could leave stuff unexplored. Each player can fill a million or so.
Imagine r/place but with a shortage of people willing to expand ever bigger, and balance it kind of, and throw in turing complete shapeshifting blobs battling eachother.
the uint10 glowing distance caches would not be copied. only the JS code strings and positions and velocities would be copied, and less often,
the recursive quadtree based 1 terapixel sparse image at 2 bits per 2x2 fork or wall or nonwall or transparent/unspecifiedIfItsWallOrNot.
As far as I know, nobody has ever made a massively multiplayer video game that is entirely decentralized. The hundreds of megabytes of RAM it uses is decentralized.
It updates random areas of 64k numbers at a time, and they converge to exactly the same thing nomatter that order. -- https://x.com/benrayfield/status/1857940083254411506
There is a likely opensource upgrade path to swarm the combined exaflop/sec of those computers GPUs plus whatever even greater cloud supercomputers some fewer users might
hook in thru digital signatures, to scale up my neural-(playdough-like) blob monster like in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4boQ9OvRz5U

Dagball 2024-5-7 recurrent sigmoid neuralnet with 22 nodes trained live in GPU shader (GLSL)
<<My dagball/lib/Ap.js GPU programming language is used in the textarea on the left to define the neuralet.
It does gradient descent with momentum and annealing automatically of
whatever you type in there. By dragging around the icons, some bright and some dark, I shape the bright
and dark areas. It does at least 1 training batch per video frame 1/60
second, sometimes around 6 batches per 1/60 second. This will in theory scale up to doing live neural qlearning
in a GPU shader on tiny neuralnets and to fit many such
neuralnets together to do bigger things, or at least to make the dagball game more curvy, bouncy, bendy, and fun.

OLD:
2024-12-3+ Shrinking Blob Monsters Game to 256k X 256k canvas cuz of new kind of wall (vs open area) voxels.
Each fits in a float64 and is an integer from 2**16 to (2**53)-1. 0 is null. Each has a payload of 16 bits for 4x4,
scaled to any powOf2 size. Each has 37 bits of binheap address.
It can only display 8k X 8k at a time which is 64 megapixels, but it wraps. You get 1024 blocks of 64 megapixels each
so 64 gigapixels. 32 blocks wide and 32 blocks tall. Theres no loading time to move across them cuz it wraps.
My new kind of 53 bit voxels (that fit in a normal javascript number) will be useful for video compression,
can each define up to 68,719,476,736 pixels, of 1 bit color each (wall vs open area).
1x1 2x2 4x4 8x8 ... 131072x131072 262144x262144, and defines 4x4 squares inside that.
I'm literally going to use them to define walls vs open areas in the 262144x262144 pixel game area
in massively multiplayer, which cuz of this will allow the terrain shape to change during the game,
depending what kind of game rules it is. This is a kind of number, where every integer thats at least 65536, without limit
toward infinity, is a voxel. It just keeps getting bigger. You could use them as bigints, but I'm using float64s for speed.

	//if(Math.random()<.01) throw new Error('should every gob be required to have centerY and centerX Vars? that seems it would interfere with wall gobs having 0 params to mark that they dont need to be recomputed. But with centerY and centerX vars we could automaticly update gob.oy and gob.ox. Id like to but theres still the issue of rounding. Var.p (such as centerY.p) is a float64 and changes smoothly. If voxels are relative to that, theyd have to round/floor/ceil it (such as |0). I could make a func similar to YXC(y,x,color) that takes numbers bigger than the 8kX8k, relative to gob.oy gob.ox, but it would likely cost some speed. It seems the output format should change so that ints oy ox go with the int[numVoxels]. {oy: 323633, ox: 800000, ints: Int32Array(numVoxels)}, or could put oy and ox as fields in the Int32Array. I want things to appear in whole near the sides of the 8kX8k, and disappear when they cross out of it, so the size it can touch should be alot less than that. Maybe 2kX2k, since 4 of those wide can fit in 8k. they would partially overlap. I need some minimum space for interesting patterns to form. is 2kX2k enuf? If so, any 2kX2k that at all overlaps the middle 2kX2k must be included, and any 2kX2k that goes even slightly outside the current 8kX8k must be removed for sparsity. therefore i can mask it with 22 bits (11 of each 13 bits for y and x) so that it automatically only generates within some 2kX2k square. So AND it with 0b00111111111110011111111111111111. That will put it in 1 of the corners of the 8kX8k thats exactly 2kX2k. But how to offset it from there? and how to know what such ints to generate? Working on the million X million pixel addressing in Blob Monsters Game. It fits 8kX8k in RAM. If I limit each monster to a moving 2kX2k square, that it can only put voxels in that, then I could have these 2kX2k squares come in from the sides when they entirely fit in the 8kX8k. ... generalize that to powers of 2, so a wall gob could have a size of 64x64 for example, and its oy and ox be powOf2 aligned so they fit as tiles simply, and in the js code string include base64 of the compressed pic format BitPic/BloomTree that i use in dagball. ... it seems oy and ox would be the top left corner, so centerY.p and centerX.p are not the same (center vs top left), and need another o var like oshift. oy+(voxel&((1<<oshift)-1)) or something like that. but it would actually get optimized to just adding an int voxel to everything in the int voxels list, since an int voxel has 13 bits y 13 bits x 6 bits color. ... Find a way to make the whole game state, including interactive gobs and walls, be a vector where every dimension has position and velocity, including .influence (like in dagball.Circ.influence and dagball.Ball.influence) as a dimension but a lower precision one cuz its either on or off in Blob Monsters Game. When you edit a wall with circular paintbrush using 2 mouse buttons, one to paint wall and one to paint open area removing wall, that should navigate the vector space of possible game states. game.rps.distToPoten is 1024 ints (might switch to uint16s?). that should be 1024 dimensions. Theres various other params in game too, excluding the caches that can be derived from vector state of the game. A particular player viewing an area of the game at an x y zoom, that seems like vector dimensions. Where could ed25519 pubkeys controlling some monsters (a player controls a character in the game) be represented as vector of game state? Every dimension should have a Var instance, so theres some new Var instances to create. I should in theory be able to represent the vectors as a set of Var instances. But its not so simple, cuz theyre spread around various object types. Every Var should have a global id by hash, though these wont be copied thru network every time. Should a Var have an optional parent Var, which gob.influence would be such a Var for the whole gob, and gob.vars would be its childs? Should Var also have a namespace (game.ns) so can make up new vectors without affecting the current game? ... TODO something like this?... /namespaceABC/game/distToPoten0 /namespaceABC/game/distToPoten1023 /namespaceABC/monster567sHashId/centerY /namespaceABC/monster567sHashId/centerX /namespaceABC/monster567sHashId/heightToWidthRatio, and each of those refers to a Var. That could be its primaryKey. /namespaceABC/monster567sHashId would also be a Var and is the .influence of that gob, and thatGob.vars would be its childs including /namespaceABC/monster567sHashId/heightToWidthRatio which is a Var. ... Vars are becoming a tree, like V/namespaceABC/monster567sHashId/heightToWidthRatio exists if V/namespaceABC/monster567sHashId has position 1, and does not exist if it has position 0. In theory, if u paint a small area of the huge game world with mouse, the thing you painted is a Var which contains that compressed pic data, and its name is the hash of that, and if its value/var.p/position is 1 then it exists and that displays, else doesnt display, across world. If u want to screw with it, just make up a new namespace like V/kj4w3e5q3ew45rtdsfg43534e5 u just make up a random string and copy the relevant parts into there in new Var objects, and explore variants of the global game state. multiverse vectors. ... ot sure where the tree of Var objects goes in the OSI Model of the internet, which is an attempt to map whats out there. I want 1 million simultaneous players, using turing-complete compression of voxel generating lambdas to game together. Experiment, turing completeness expands (SEE PIC "2024-11-17 where does the tree of Var objects fit into the OSI model.png"). most data will be transferred in filenames. file content is constant size, float64s for position velocity etc. Kinda like OpenCogs TruthValue but more limited, simpler, not well organized. But will stream hella fast from everywhere to everywhere. megabyte filenames shrink by hash. The tree of Var objects is a level below constraint solving, but levels above that, Blob Monsters Game does play as a game, not very fun yet, but it works by constraint solving among many millions of bits.');

	...
	amountCollidingVolume is with other voxels depending on voxelId, as some pairs are allowed
	to collide (no collision detection between voxels of the same object cuz they're meant to
	partially overlap to form a smoother surface of the balls). whatever collision there are
	based on set of voxels, for all colliding pairs, add the intersecting volume to
	amountCollidingVolume of each. I've observed in my game physics so far that objects
	pushing on eachother more have greater amountCollidingVolume, so I think we can use
	amountCollidingVolume as force for use with coefficientOfFriction
	
	GPT said[[[
	Role of amountCollidingVolume
		Collision Metric:
		The field amountCollidingVolume represents the total volume of overlap (or penetration) between voxels from different objects. Voxels of the same object are designed to partially overlap to create smoother surfaces, so you’re only summing overlaps between different objects.
		Proxy for Contact Force:
		Empirical observations in your simulation indicate that greater colliding volume correlates with stronger interactions between objects. You can treat this value as a proxy for the normal force exerted during collisions. In traditional friction models, the frictional force is proportional to the normal force (using Ffriction=μ⋅FnormalFfriction​=μ⋅Fnormal​). Here, amountCollidingVolume can serve as a stand-in for FnormalFnormal​, modulated by your chosen friction coefficients.

	im trying to run this in CPU (not GPU) in browser of good gaming computer. Friction only need be calculated in voxels whose amountCollidingVolume>0, so most voxels will never compute that. Same for repelling by a force propotional to some function of total amountCollidingVolume per object.

	Each object is a js lambda with a position and velocity for each of its params. It returns a list of these voxels in a big Float32Array(numVoxels<<4) as each voxel is 16 floats. If there are 11 params it will call this 12 times per physics cycle per object, once with params as they are, and once with each param having epsilon added and the other 10 params as they are, by finite difference method to compute gradient and jacobian. There is a 3d*11d jacobian at each voxel, so whatever 3d force is applied to a voxel will push thru to the 11 params which generated it, like backprop on the 11 params of the js func.
	
	Its by design that a voxel's friction force (to accelerate by) can be computed by its own 16 floats, without needing to know which other voxels are colliding with it. But we do still need to add up amountCollidingVolume based on the set of all pairs of colliding voxels (loop so u dont have to store the set). Store in a 3d grid, of 512**3, in an Array(1<<27), a [] list of voxels there. Make each a Float32Array(16); Write out the 16 consts, using the prefix VB for voxel ball, like const VBZ VBY VBX VBRadius VBHIT (amountCollidingVolume), etc. 16 such constants, that u use with the Float32Array's. A voxel will go in the bucket deterministicly based on its position, where position ranges 0 (incl) to 8192 (excl) so each bucket is 16x16x16 size in game coords and is basically a set (as a []) of float arrays of 16 floats each. cuz 16*512=8192. this is basically about 16 pixels wide so not too much ball voxels (vbvoxels) will get in there at once

	//and put a different amount of poten in it. Instead of max(0,game.board[i]-1) with the linear and squared sums of
	//its diffs per gob, loss aka potentialEnergy is defined as var.poten sum (as usual in case it wants to add more)
	//but dont add that part here, and most importantly, the sum of game.sqBoard[pixelIndex]**2 forall pixels,
	//and update the display to show its smooth curves like in dagball andOr as a 3d isomorphic heightmap from 2d floor.
	//Dagball has color but leaves brightness to the heightmap. Id prefer 3d isomorphic form of it maybe,
	//but colorDirectionOnly with height being brightness is easier to get started displaying it.
	//Make sure to include "walls" as just adding arbitrary amount to the .board or .sqBoard (whichever i end up using)
	//as an actual heightmap.
	//sqPoten might be too small to store the sum of squares for all pixels,
	//but i could do it as the sum of 2 numbers, one thats an integer multiple of 2**52 and the other thats the low bits,
	//and when the low one rolls over
	//potential energy at 2d pixel, summing number or total weight of voxels overlapping there = (height^2)/2

	im thinking of making a new kind of voxel: z 21 bits, y 13 bits, x 13 bits, color 6 bits. total 53 bits so it
	fits in a float64 number range 0 to (2**53)-1 without roundoff. I have a 2d 8192x8192 array to sum these in.
	All voxels at same x y, stack on eachother, forming hills.
	If z is 21 bits that means theres about 2 million possible heights, so you can view the heightmap as stacks
	of rectangles that are 1x1x(1/256), so if you stack 256 of them you get a 1x1x1, very thin vertically so
	the hill smoothness does good physics.
	x and y already have practically unlimited range but I wrap it around whatever 8k X 8k is nearest
	and load/unload the other parts of game as needed

So the data structure has to be separate for walls. Make it 1 bit per pixel in small areas, base64 BloomTree/BitPic compressed  before expanding to such small areas. Maybe make 2**24 areas of 256x256, thats a single 2**40 pixel immutable BloomTree stored in game.wal as the top WallQuad. Yes, do that. Store only the base64 string form compressed as big or small as it needs to be, but always do the expanded dense form as 256x256 blocks. If the whole million X million game area is all wall or all nonwall, that only takes 1 char to store, and dont pad it since the bloomtree/bitpic datastruct can detect when its done at a certain bit index.

//and a simple 6 bit color displayed with them so you can see which blobs made of these voxels
//are from the same object approximately.
//Its not all possible affine transforms, just the kind that puts 4 child squares per square as a quadtree
//and each square is 1/4 of the function z(y,x), called a "tarp" (search code for that),
//so you use ptr as the bottom right (x from 0 to 1) tarp (which is a square) aka that square itself,

//Qu(ptr) is its up sibling, and either Qu(Ql(ptr)) or Ql(Qu(ptr)) (they return the same int)
//is its up left sibling. So up from these 4 squares/tarps it computes integrals of
//"z = max(0, 1 - abs(x)) * max(0, 1 - abs(y))" as this square overlaps log number of parent squares,
//so it does that 4*log4(game size 8192**2 or just inside QMinPtr) times.

//we use potential energy = sum forall y forall x (z(y,x)**2)/2 which is a triangle integral,
//the amount of potential energy of solid mass from height 0 to z in units of 1/g kilograms per 1.0**3 volume.
//Potential energy of lifting 1 unit of volume by 1 distance, is 1 joule. See my writing about jouleCube
//which is a 1 meter cube of mass 1/g kilograms whose center of gravity is at the center of its top face,
//and the total potential energy of a stack of 2 jouleCubes beside a stack of 5 jouleCubes
//is 1+2+1+2+3+4+5=18 joules. They're made to always give an integer number of joules.
//This function returns the change in total potential energy of the game in joules.
//This is also true of the smooth bilinear kind, which I tested in funcs bilinearMult and bilinearPotentialEnergy.
//bilinearMult "//Very important: if all 8 params are nonnegative multiples of 6, then potential energy is an integer."
//Always use multiples of 6 for val to add or subtract at each voxel ptr,
//and scale it by the power of 2 of that quadtree level, like 6 for a 1x1 (times 4 tarps that size) voxel,
//12 for a 2x2, 24 for a 4x4, 48 for a 8x8, and so on, though as of 2025-1-31 QAdd hasnt been tested with that
//to do it all together, but it works in bilinearMult and bilinearPotentialEnergy tests as integers or scalars.
//
//The return value is most of the compute cost so make sure to use it in
//gradient calculations in blob monsters game physics. If you just want to use the
//quadtree heightmap without physics use QAddIgnorePoten which will be ALOT faster
//but if you do then you cant use QAdd (the slower way that returns change in potential energy)
//on that same array (qint and qflo) cuz qflo wont have been updated which is derived only from qint.
//Despite that qflo is derived only from qint, to derive it again all at once would be very slow.
//The advantage of QAdd is it costs only log compute time to do a full update across the whole game
//and should, in theory if you use multiples of 6 as val (or 12 if twice as big a level, or 24 if 4x as big...)
//then change in potential energy will always be an integer and will fit in an int54 by using
//only the first n layers like maybe 1x1 2x2 4x4 8x8 16x16 32x32 64x64 but not anything bigger,
//or im not sure where it should be cut off but thats in QMinPtr.
//You could do it all the way to 8192x8192 as its still just a log cost,
//but you'd need more digits of precision than is in float64 and would need to use bigints like 1n 2n 3n...
//or to use maybe 4 ints as an int128 and do it with Math.imul,
//those ints would go in game.qint of 4096x4096 (cuz max array size is 1gB).
//
//Use negative val to remove.
//Ptr 1 is the root quadtree node. Use Qp to get parent of ptr. Qu Qd Ql Qr get siblings and wrap.

//qint is straightforward to update. Its low 6 bits is xor of all voxels overlapping here,
//and its high 26 bits are added to z aka thickness there, as mountains and valleys in the heightmap
//can be summed of many voxels each of different position and powOf2 size and thickness multiplier.
//So that explains that qint is straightforward to update. The hard part is updating qflo,
//where the QEdgeWeight update between ptrs. So I'm not sure if this will ever be efficient on GPU

	2025-2-18 mmMain:redesignDisorganizedBuggyTiles2025-2-18+ which led to the creation
	of Var.e and TODO Var.setE(number) or something like that TODO.
	
	Ive probably broken the loading of tiles again but ive got to mmMain:"fix why the tiles are appearing/disappearing approx like they should but at a few hundred pixels past where the gobs appear/disappear at the sparse distance (see sparseUpdate)"

	This whole tile thing is getting too complex. Its time for a small redesign, to get things straight in the design before writing more code. Its too many places things are being stored:
	Var.ob is a QuadTile, which has a square (uint53) and a Quad.
	game.wal is a BigTile containing Tile's.
	tile.dense is a 128x128 byte array.
	tile.sparse is a Quad.
	game.board is modified by a Quad in Tile.prototype.paintGame and it remembers that in tile.lastPaintedQuadOnGame (similar to gob.voxInGame int array but its a Quad instead).

	Theres also autoEval in Var.

	Theres Var.p NOT being used for create/delete at height 2 (V.testnet.objectName.p). State was supposed to be in the Var tree but some parts are not, and its causing an avalanche of cache errors that confusing me and getting way too much stuff tangled.
	Maybe I need a bit field in Var to say if its in the game or not, or a scalar field to say gradually how much, 0 to 1 in the simplest case.
	I recently changed Gob to not change its Var (gob.bo is a Var whose Var.ob is that Gob) when you edit the textarea. The var changes, but its a new Gob. Similarly, I dont want state stored in Tile thats not in Var, which might mean I have to redesign how you paint on BigTile to queue updates in some other structure and do them all at once (before next video frame).

	These redesigns wont be covered here[[[
	wikib upgrades.
	gob.m.isSelected etc put in the Var tree.
	redesign gob.brain funcs to not modify their param Vars and instead be a pure-function (except maybe the mouse gob that reads Controls.mouseY etc) but I dont know how to do that efficiently.
	]]]

	This might turn into a bigger redesign than I thought, but think thru it carefully. In general I think I want to make game.wal (which is a BigTile) be a backing wrapper of the V/Var tree instead of storing out of sync caches of it, and I likely want another upgrade to the Var class which is Var.pExistsInGame but find something smaller to write it as maybe p.e. Yes, lets call it p.e for amount of eval, thats supposed to usually be the same as .p but .e goes thru more security checks, while .p can be changed by merging V tree across internet, its only evaled (TODO) into game.board etc  if !!p.e where p.e is normally 0 or 1. Also, we dont share Var.e across internet cuz its about local views of the Var tree, such as viewing it in a specific game.board game.gobs game.wal etc.
	...
	And im gonna need events to update things whenever .e changes, so .setE func instead of setting .e directly?

	//This is an experimental field of Var added 2024-11-13 to try to solve that gobs overlap too much, take too long to accel away from eachother,

//paint int voxels (YXC or YXRGB etc) overwriting whatever color6 and isWall bit may have already been there,

//which means you cant do ghostVox this way, but its less confusing to players since they can see by color only
//if something is solid vs a place they can move through. So far 2025-2-19 Ive only used ghostVox to draw
//coordinate lines on the game, and hopefully that will be the only time I ever use it.
//Technically tile Vars, cuz they wrap Quad bytes, can do ghostVox and normal vox,
//but u can do more advanced things by using Var directly.
//Example: V.testnet.paintInts(someGob.voxInGame); Its called on the namespace, where tile Vars go,
//using thatNamespace.game.Y.p and thatNamespace.game.X.p to transform between global and local 8192x8192 coords.
//
//To UNPAINT/delete the int voxels, paint color 0 there.
//
//Coordinates are the usual 8192x8192 view of the 2**24 by 2**24 space, but whatever game.Y.p and game.X.p
//wraps around that 8192x8192, thats the bigger coordinate that it means. Only near parts of game can be painted
//this way. To paint farther away you can make the tile132453245$hash4325345... Vars directly,
//as they will be shared that way across peer to peer network (TODO). The V/Var tree is the game state,
//so we have to convert to that before painting, moving gobs, adjusting game options, etc.
//These are the same kind of voxels the gob.brain js lambdas generate as [] lists of ints.
//You can give a [] list or Int32Array or Uint32Array as param here.
//These ints can cover multiple Tiles which are each a 128x128 block. See TileKey func.
//This func normally sets Var.p to 0 on those to remove and Var.p to 1 on those to create,

As of 2025-2 you can get some versions (its just a html file) at https://github.com/benrayfield/jsutils/tree/master/src/blobMonstersGame and play it at https://humanai.net/experiments/blobMonstersGame.html aka https://tinyurl.com/blobmonster . Its incomplete, but... The New empty universe button doesnt just start playing a new game. It starts building a game like programming and content creation. And at the same time it plays the game. If you just want to play some game, thats the restart last minigame button. TODO alot of thats not working yet or is not hooked into this code but is somewhere else todo. Quicksave and Quickload are in the game of making possible games and playing them, of this limited kind where you divide it into small javascript functions of vector to list of int voxels.');" style="float:left">
